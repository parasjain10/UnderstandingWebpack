    <!-- 
    <script src="./src/hello-world.js"></script>
    <script src="./src/index.js"></script> 

    In this if you see the file hello-world.js contain a function 
     which is invoked in index.js but if the order of script is changed 
     then function will not be called, thus there is a dependency issue.

     <script src="./src/index.js"></script>
     <script src="./src/hello-world.js"></script> 
     // This will not work as helloWorld 
     is not defined when index.js is executed.

     Suppose we have multiple files and each file has dependencies on
     other files, it can become difficult to manage the order in which
     the scripts are loaded. This is where Webpack comes in.


     Webpack is a module bundler that resolves these dependencies and
     bundles the files together so that the function is available when
     the script is executed.
